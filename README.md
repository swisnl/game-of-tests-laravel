# Game of Tests laravel 

[![Latest Stable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/swisnl/game-of-tests-laravel/v/stable)](https://packagist.org/packages/game-of-tests-laravel) [![License](https://poser.pugx.org/swisnl/game-of-tests-laravel/license)](https://packagist.org/packages/swisnl/game-of-tests-laravel)


This package aims to enable a quick implementation of a Game of Tests in Laravel. Is uses the package [swisnl/game-of-tests](https://github.com/swisnl/game-of-tests/) and gives you a set of commands and basic templates to make your own Game of Tests.

This package serves as a way to search through git repositories and find PHP tests. I was inspired by the the [Spotify testing game](https://github.com/spotify/testing-game) I ran in to.

The reason i wanted to my own implementation for PHP was to help gamify testing in the company and encourage testing in general in the teams.

# How does it work?

The Game of Tests works by scanning Git repositories and scanning for known test files. It uses Git blame to attribute tests to developers. You can update through multiple artisan commands for Github, bare directories, or single repositories.

For now it supports PhpUnit, Codeception and Behat for PHP and Ava, Jasmine, Jest, Mocha, Tape and QUnit for JavaScript and True for SCSS. Feel free to contribute new parsers to [swisnl/game-of-tests](https://github.com/swisnl/game-of-tests/).

# Demo

I made a demo available which uses this package and show the Game of Tests for the Laravel Github organisation at [http://gameoftests.swis.nl](http://gameoftests.swis.nl). For in information on installing the demo locally, please check out [swisnl/game-of-tests-laravel-demo](https://github.com/swisnl/game-of-tests-laravel-demo).

``/got/score-for-month`` | Ranking of the current month. Optionally you can add: ``?monthsBack=[months]`` to go back any amount of months. For example to get the tests of last month: ``app.url/got/score-for-month?monthsBack=1``.
``/got/score-for-months-back`` | Ranking of the last [months] months (default 1 month). You can add: ``?monthsBack=[months]`` to go back any amount of months. For example to get the tests of last 3 months: ``app.url/got/score-for-month?monthsBack=3``.
``/got/{user}`` | List of parsed tests of ``{user}``. You can add: ``?fromMonthsBack=[months]`` to go back any amount of months.
